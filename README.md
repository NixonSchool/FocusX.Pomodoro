🔒 40 minutes of deep work → 10-minute forced break.
No mercy. No “just five more minutes.” Your screen blacks out, keyboard & mouse disabled, and audio muted—you're out. 🚶‍♂️

⏳ No annoying alerts. Just work till the screen goes dark.
🌙 Midnight? Game over. Your PC shuts down. Sleep or stare at a black screen. 😴💀

💡 Anti-cheat mode? Yep. It syncs with NTP servers to block sneaky time hacks.
💻 Hardcore version coming soon—one that completely takes over your computer.

This is not your average pomodoro. This is FocusX. Stay tuned. 🚀🔥

I'm planning to add an internet disabler for those who want to completely cut off online distractions during focus sessions.

Additionally, I'll introduce a reverse mode—where the screen stays blacked out during work and only turns back on during breaks. This way, you can’t use your computer at all while working, forcing you to focus on offline tasks. Then, when the break starts, your screen unlocks, allowing you to check messages, browse, or do whatever you want.

This will take FocusX to the next level—no more loopholes, no more excuses. 🔥💻🚀

Am not online for now, but when am back, I will make a better version and hidden megaprojects for the hardcore computer lovers.
