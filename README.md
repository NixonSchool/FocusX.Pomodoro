FocusX: No distractions. Just focus.

🔒 40 minutes of uninterrupted grind, then a 10-minute mandatory break. But don’t just sit there — step away from your screen. 🚶‍♂️

This app locks you down: blocks your screen, mutes your audio, and disables your mouse and keyboard. No cheat codes allowed.

And if you stay still? You’re out. No annoying reminders — just a reset, time to move, stretch, or clear your mind. 💭

At midnight? The game’s over. Your computer shuts down. Hit the bed, or enjoy a black screen. 😴💻🔥

Focus. Break. Repeat. Get things DONE.

And don’t even think about cheating — the second script syncs your time to make sure you stay honest. If you’re trying to reverse the clock, it might be time for a real break. Or maybe get an accountability buddy. 😉
