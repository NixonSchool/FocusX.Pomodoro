FocusX: No distractions. Just focus.

🔒 40 minutes of uninterrupted grind, then a 10-minute mandatory break. But don’t just sit there — step away from your screen. 🚶‍♂️

This app locks you down: blocks your screen, mutes your audio, and disables your mouse and keyboard. No cheat codes allowed.

And if you stay still? You’re out. No annoying reminders — just a reset, time to move, stretch, or clear your mind. 💭

At midnight? The game’s over. Your computer shuts down. Hit the bed, or enjoy a black screen. 😴💻🔥

Focus. Break. Repeat. Get things DONE.

And don’t even think about cheating — the second script syncs your time using NTP servers, to ensure you don't change your time and escape the FocusX matrix. 

If you’re trying to reverse the clock to get some more time, maybe this isn't your software, get an accountability partner. 😉

This is the first release, am going to improve it, make it smaller, and more complex with a better UI and more features, as time goes by.
