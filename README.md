FocusX: No distractions. Just focus.

🔒 40 minutes of uninterrupted focusing, then a 10-minute mandatory break. This is not the ordinary pomodoro which allows you to do stuff after the 40 minutes are over, it literally throws you out by blackscreening everything and disabling your keyboard and mouse. 🚶‍♂️Mutes your audio incase you were playing some music.

There's no annoying reminders that your work time has ended, the screen just blacks-out. 

At midnight? The game’s over. Your computer shuts down on its own. Hit the bed, or enjoy a black screen. 😴💻🔥

I prefer you compile with the second screen coz it re-synchronizes your time with NTP servers, to beat your cheating mind. 

If you're addicted to cheating, just get an accountability partner, or wait for the future where I will release a more complex version that will literally take over your computer and you won't do anything at all. 

We need such an app. Am going to better it with time.
