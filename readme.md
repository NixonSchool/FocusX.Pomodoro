FocusX:
No distractions. Just focus. 🚀

🔒 40 minutes of pure concentration.

After that? A solid 10-minute break. But don’t just sit there staring at your screen — actually step away. 🚶‍♂️

This app takes control, blocking your screen, muting your music, and disabling your mouse and keyboard. No cheat codes here. It might not be perfect, but atleast works.

And don’t even think about staying still — if you don’t move, you’ll get kicked out. No nagging reminders to take a break; it's just time to reset, go for a walk, or let your mind wander. 💭

At 12 AM, the game’s over. Your computer shuts down. Time to hit the bed, or you’ll face the wrath of a black screen. 😴💻🔥

Focus. Break. Repeat. Get stuff DONE.

Oh, and the second script syncs your time, making it nearly impossible to cheat. If you’re thinking of reversing the clock, well... maybe it’s time to step away from the computer, or find an accountability partner to keep you in check.
